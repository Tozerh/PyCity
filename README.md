## Project Overvew
PyCity Schools reached out for an analysis of their test scores. PyCity provided the raw data in csv form, and requested a series of slices of the data based on school size, school type, school name, etc. In order to complete this project, we had to deploy the pandas software library, which allows us to manipulate the raw data in Python and to generate the necessary tables. Ultimately, our goal with this project was to assist the school district in understanding how one school's academic dishonesty affected the entire district's reported metrics. 


## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1 (with pandas library), Jupyter Notebooks

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?

- How is the school summary affected?

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

- Math and reading scores by grade

- Scores by school spending

- Scores by school size

- Scores by school type

## Suggestions to Modify Code for Other Elections
